## App Overview

### Book Search

The Book Search page allows users to search for books by name using the Open Library API. It displays search results, and users can add books to their bookshelf from here.

## Bookshelf

The Bookshelf page displays the user's bookshelf, where all the books they've added are listed. Users can delete books from their bookshelf here. The bookshelf is maintained in the browser using localStorage, so it persists across page reloads and browser sessions.
